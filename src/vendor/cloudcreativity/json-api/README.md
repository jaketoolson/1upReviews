# cloudcreativity/json-api

This repository extends [neomerx/json-api](https://github.com/neomerx/json-api), adding in several additional
framework-agnostic features. These are:

1. **Apis**: JSON API configuration on a per-API basis, to support applications having many JSON APIs (e.g. version
controlled for public facing APIs) each with different settings.
2. **Store**: Maps JSON API identifiers to specific models/entities, and translates query parameters into 
queries for models/entities.
3. **Hydrators**: Handles the transfer of data from JSON API resources representations into models/entities. 
4. **Validators**: A full suite of validators for validating JSON API documents (HTTP request body content) and 
returning JSON API errors.
5. **Errors**: Mutable errors allow JSON API errors to be added to via your application stack and construction from
arrays.

For a framework specific implementation, see 
[cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api)
